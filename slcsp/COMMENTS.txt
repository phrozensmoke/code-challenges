The homework was completed in Python. Even though I've been working mostly with Java in recent years, I've always found Python 
to be faster / more-efficient for this type of text parsing and processing and, usually, Python can handle it with fewer lines of code than Java.

No special libraries are needed.  This Python version was testing with Python 3.7.3 


INSTRUCTIONS 

PYTHON VERSION (built with Python 3.7.3 on a Windows 10 machine):
1. Open an MS-DOS prompt (or Linux/Unix shell)
2. Ensure that the plans.csv, zips.csv, and slcsp.csv files are in the SAME folder/directory as the python script.
3. Run the python script with the command 'python homework2.py' 




SPECIAL NOTES: 
On the Windows machine, Python automatically appends a 'new-line' character after each line printed to stdout for the CSV.  I did not have access to any other operating 
systems at the time I did this homework to test if this is also the case on Mac and/or Linux/Unix.

The file 'verification_notes' are just notes I took to manually verify that any 'blank' zip codes were legitimately blank.
